## Code Implementation Introduction
After completing the development and deployment of the custom operator, you can verify the functionality of the single operator by invoking it. The code in src/main.cpp is the execution method for the single operator API. The single operator API execution is based on the C language API to execute the operator, without the need to provide a single operator description file for offline model conversion, directly calling the single operator API interface.

After the custom operator is compiled and deployed, the single operator API is automatically generated and can be directly called in the application. The operator API is generally defined in the form of a "two-stage interface", such as:
   ```cpp    
   aclnnStatus aclnnFastGeluGetWorkspaceSize(const aclTensor *x, const aclTensor *y, const alcTensor *out, uint64_t workspaceSize, aclOpExecutor **executor);
   aclnnStatus aclnnFastGelu(void *workspace, int64_t workspaceSize, aclOpExecutor **executor, aclrtStream stream);
   ```
aclnnFastGeluGetWorkspaceSize is the first-phase API, which is used to compute the workspace size required for calling the FastGelu operator API. After obtaining the workspace size, allocate memory on the device based on workspaceSize, and call the second-phase API aclnnFastGelu to perform computation.For specific reference, see the [AscendCL Single Operator Invocation](https://hiascend.com/document/redirect/CannCommunityAscendCInVorkSingleOp) > Single Operator API Execution section.

## Running the Example Operator
### 1. Compile the Operator Project
Before running this example, please refer to [Compile the Operator Project](../README.en.md#operatorcompile) to complete the preparation.

### 2. Run the aclnn Example

  - Enter the example directory

    ```bash
    cd ${git_clone_path}/samples/operator_contrib/FastGeluSample/FrameworkLaunch/AclNNInvocation
    ```

  - Example execution    

    During the example execution, test data will be automatically generated, then the aclnn example will be compiled and run, and finally the runtime results will be verified. The specific process can be seen in the run.sh script.

    ```bash
    bash run.sh
    ```
