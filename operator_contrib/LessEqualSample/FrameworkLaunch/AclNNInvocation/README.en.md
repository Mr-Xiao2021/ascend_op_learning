## Code Implementation Introduction
After the development and deployment of the custom operator are completed, the functionality of the single operator can be verified through single operator invocation. The code in src/main.cpp is the execution method for single operator API. Single operator API execution is based on the C language API to execute operators, without the need to provide a single operator description file for offline model conversion, directly calling the single operator API interface.

After the custom operator is compiled and deployed, the single operator API is automatically generated and can be directly called in the application. The operator API is generally defined in the form of "two-stage interface", such as:
   ```cpp    
   aclnnStatus aclnnLessEqualGetWorkspaceSize(const aclTensor *x, const aclTensor *y, const alcTensor *out, uint64_t workspaceSize, aclOpExecutor **executor);
   aclnnStatus aclnnLessEqual(void *workspace, int64_t workspaceSize, aclOpExecutor **executor, aclrtStream stream);
   ```
Where aclnnLessEqualGetWorkspaceSize is the first stage interface, mainly used to calculate how much workspace memory is needed during this API call. After obtaining the workspace size required for this API calculation, allocate Device-side memory according to the workspaceSize, and then call the second stage interface aclnnLessEqual to perform the calculation. For details, please refer to the [AscendCL Single Operator Invocation](https://hiascend.com/document/redirect/CannCommunityAscendCInVorkSingleOp) > Single Operator API Execution section.

## Running the Example Operator
### 1. Compile the Operator Project
Before running this example, please refer to [Compile the Operator Project](../README.en.md#operatorcompile) to complete the preparation.

### 2. aclnn Invocation Example Execution

  - Enter the example directory

    ```bash
    cd ${git_clone_path}/samples/operator_contrib/LessEqualSample/FrameworkLaunch/AclNNInvocation
    ```

  - Example execution    

    During the example execution, test data will be automatically generated, then the aclnn example will be compiled and run, and finally the running results will be verified. The specific process can be found in the run.sh script.

    ```bash
    bash run.sh
    ```
